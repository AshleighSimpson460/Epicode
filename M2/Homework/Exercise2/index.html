        /*
        EXERCISE 2) Create an index.html file with the <script> tag in it
        You are trying to estimate the total worth of your garage and you’re going to create a simple algorithm that calculates it by using variables, console.log(), prompt() and alert()
         1) Create a variable to get the number of cars, inside you will save the result of a prompt() function that asks the user how many cars he/she has in the garage
         2) Next, create anotehr variable to ask the user how much a car is worth these days on average, in the same way as before, by using the prompt() function
         3) Do the same for motorbikes and bikes
         4) Create 3 variables to hold the value of cars, motorbikes and bikes by multiplying the number of each by the average of each
         5) Check each of the 3 variables content with console logs. Then create a totalGarageValue variable that sums the three values together.
         6) Use an alert() function to display the garage worth in the end with a nice message

         You should now have a popup with the garage’s total estimate worth 
            */

        const TotalCarsOwned = prompt('How many cars are in your garage?');
        const CarValue = prompt('How much is the car(s) worth today?');
        const TotalMotorbikesOwned = prompt('How many Motorbikes are in your garage?');
        const MotorbikeValue = prompt('How much is the motorbike(s) worth today?');
        const TotalBikesOwned = prompt('How many bikes are in your garage');
        const BikeValue = prompt('How much are the bike(s) worth today');
        const ValeuOfCar = TotalCarsOwned * CarValue;
        const ValueOfMotorbike = TotalMotorbikesOwned * BikeValue;
        const ValueOfBike = TotalBikesOwned * BikeValue;

        const TotalGarageValue = ValueOfBike + ValeuOfCar + ValueOfMotorbike;

        alert("Your garage is worth roughly:","TotalGarageValue");
