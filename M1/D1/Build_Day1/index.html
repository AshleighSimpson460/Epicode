        <p>My name is Ashleigh Simpson, I prefer to keep my life private so I will not upload any sensitive information like my social media usernames etc. However, I do believe that I can upload more things
            about myself to sound interesting enough to show I understood the tasks given during our day 1 course for our EPICODE introduction.</p>
           <p>my hobbies and interestes are as follows:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Gaming</li>
                   <li>I like to take naps often like a cat</li>
                   <li>My favourite cuisine is Caribbean food</li>
                   <li>In my spare time I usually hang out with my girlfriend</li>
                   <li>My favourite drink is Lucozade</li>
                </ul>

       <p><a>I am a very introverted individual who at first wanted to have a career in IT Support and had a career change into a field based role due to the fact that
        my first experience in the IT field was not enjoyable, I have a knack for doing engineering which was more hands on with power tools and other handy man tools, however
        that field was really difficult to land a full-time job in without having the correct qualifications so I decided to search for <b>another</b> career path to get into
        I stumbled across EPICODE and thought I HAD to give this a go because the offer was amazingly good. Had a phone call with Chiara and she was so lovely to talk to it made me
        feel welcomed already and now I am here studying 4weeks before my course starts to make sure I do not lag behind!</p></a>
